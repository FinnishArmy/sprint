# Essential Questions

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
Interpretting user needs is a crucial step in developing code and programs that are going to end up being usable by 
the end user. This is exactly what user stories are for; user stories tells you how the user will be using your end 
product. By guiding your program in such a way that caters towards the wishes of the user stories, you develop a
program in the vision of the end user themselves.

With the user stories, you can develop a backlog of requirements to meet before you deploy the program. This
ensures that your end product provides actual value to the end user. Not only this, but you develop a prioritization
list which caters to the need of the end users, making the user stories the most critical things to 'solve' or 'develop'
to.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing a program by first figuring out what the end goal actually is. I create requirments that I need
to meet before I feel satisfied with it being deployed. Once those requirements are met, then I can move onto adding
additional features as needed/wanted, and ensuring the code is as efficient as possible. I like the planning poker 
estimation process from the agile methodology as it gives a fantastic estimate on how long a project will take or 
how long each section will take to complete within the project. I hope to use this in future programming projects
that require multiple developers.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe what it means to be a good team membjer in software developemtn is that you can adapt to the needs
of the team as a whole. You may have your own style of writing code or developing, but you must cater in such a way
that each team meber can understand how you code and why you choose certain things over others. You need to be open
to adjusting code that you may think is good but other team members may suggest otherwise. Be able to discuss
openly about the development cycle.
